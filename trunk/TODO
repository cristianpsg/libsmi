o error detection: detect IMPORTs of SMIv1 specific and SMIv2 specific
  items in the same module, e.g. old OBJECT-TYPE macro and (new)
  NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro.

o error detection: does table node have exactly one row sub node
  with oid == 1? (2578.7.10)

o warning detection: empty strings in DESCRIPTION and similar clauses

o warning detection: non continuous sub oids in column node list?

o warning detection: integer(signed) in index

o error detection: parser-smi.y: remember SEQUENCE contents and check them

o remove SMI_DECL_IMPL_SEQUENCEOF from smi.h: the smiv1/smiv2 parser 
  should keep internal data structures for sequence types so that it 
  can set the correct nodekinds and that it can check the SEQUENCE 
  contents (see previous item). these internal data structures can
  be released at the end of a MIB module.

o warning detection: check, whether OIDs of indexed columns might be
  longer than 128 subids.

o warning detection: enumerations SHOULD NOT contain signedNumber's.
  SHOULD start at 1. SHOULD be numbered contiguously.
  e.g. DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB.SnmpPduErrorStatus

o warning detection: zeroDotZero defined locally instead of
  imported from SMI.

o warning detection: max-access for a counter must be readonly

o warning detection: subtyping not allowed for counter or timeticks

o warning detection: defvals not allowed for counter



o parser-smi.y: handle forbidden WS at some places
  ( Module . label, ...)

o dump-sming.c: ensure an order without forward references in typedef's.

o dump-sming.c: support all(!) kinds of index clauses

o smi.c: smiGetNames() is not yet implemented. do we really need it?

o thread safety (global vars? static vars? strtok() and other funcs?)
  different views

o need a handle to distinguish different views.

o clearly separate language dependent information at the API: SMI_STATUS_*
  map STATUS to a non-language-dependent type

o OID/Name Lookup Service (continue work on smid?)

o how to convert SMIng types derived from other defined types correctly
  to SMIv2?

o various dump modules don't print identifiers fully qualified where
  appropriate

o Web online conversion to SMIng?

o special handling for well-known traps (reversibility?)

o smidump -f smiv1 now prints read AUGMENTS clauses as index lists correctly
  but these index objects might not be imported.

o smidump might print defvals for OIDs by label without importing it.

o line breaks in long bits defaults values (dump-*.c)

o Add smiGetFirstChildType(SmiType *smiType) and 
  smiGetNextChildType(SmiType *smiType) to the API.

o Make sure we always get the newest definition when looking up things
  that are not unique.

o The SMIv1/SMIv2/SMIng dump modules should build proper IMPORTS for
  OIDs that show up in DEFVAL or default clauses.

o The default value conversion functions (e.g. getValueString()) should
  return malloced memory to avoid potential memory overwrite problems.
