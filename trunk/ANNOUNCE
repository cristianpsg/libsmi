Libsmi 0.2 is available for download.

Libsmi is a C library that allows network management applications to
access SMI MIB module information through a well defined API that
hides the nasty details of locating and parsing SMIv1/v2 MIB modules.
Libsmi supports exact and iterative retrieval functions for all major
SMIv1 and SMIv2 constructs.

The layered concept of libsmi allows to add further methods to
retrieve MIB information from persistent repositories. In fact,
besides the SMIv1/v2 MIB file parser an additional parser for `SMIng',
a new structure of management information elaborated by the Network
Management Research Group of the IRTF, is included. Both parsers are
built on flex/bison grammar specifications.

On top of the library, there are three tools and a sh/awk-script:
Smiquery allows simple queries of single MIB module items.  Smilint
allows to increase the verbosity of the parser(s), so that MIB module
files can be checked for syntax and semantic errors. Smidump can be
used to dump MIB modules in various formats. The current output
backends allow to dump trees of OIDs, type definitions and recursive
imports, to convert modules between SMIv1, SMIv2 and SMIng, to produce
JIDM compliant CORBA-IDL files, UCD-SNMP code stubs and MOSY style
output. Finally, smistrip allows to strip SMIv1/v2 modules from
documents like RFCs and Internet-Drafts.

Enclosed with the libsmi package, there are all (bug fixed) current
IETF standard MIB modules, as well as some other modules, man pages
for all library functions and tools, the current SMIng specification
and a libsmi test suite.

The software comes with automake/autoconf and libtool support. Hence
it should compile and build with or without shared libraries on most
UNIX style platforms, though it's just developed on Sun Solaris 2.5.x
and Linux.

Online information on libsmi together with download and CVS access
information, the (free) license terms, manual pages, and a mailing
