       DESCRIPTION 
           "A role represents a functionality characteristic or 
           capability of a resource to which policies are applied. 
           Examples of roles include Backbone interface,   
           Frame_Relay_interface, BGP-capable-router, web-server,  
           firewall, etc. 
           Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period, hyphen and 
           underscore.  A role must not start with an underscore."

   RoleCombination ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 
       STATUS       current 
       DESCRIPTION 
           "A Display string consisting of a set of roles concatenated 
           with a '+' character where the roles are in lexicographic 
           order from minimum to maximum. 
           For example, a+b and b+a are NOT different  
           role-combinations; rather, they are different formatting of 
           the same (one) role-combination. 
    
           Notice the roles within a role-combination are in 
           Lexicographic order from minimum to maximum, hence, we 
           declare: 
             a+b is the valid formatting of the role-combination, 
             b+a is an invalid formatting of the role-combination. 
    
           Notice the need of zero-length role-combination as the role- 
           combination of interfaces to which no roles have been 
           assigned. This role-combination is also known as the null 
           role-combination. (Note the deliberate use of lower case 
           letters to avoid confusion with the ASCII NULL character 
           which has a value of zero but length of one.)"

            A AttrIdentifier value is always interpreted within the  
            context of a PrcIdentifier value. The PrcIdentifier object  
            which defines the context must be registered immediately  
            before the object which uses the AttrIdentifier textual  
            convention.  
    
           An attribute with this syntax can have the value 0 to  
           indicate that it currently does not identify a PRC

           defined in the PRC entry definition. The prefix OID (after

           PRC. An attribute with this syntax can have the value 0.0
