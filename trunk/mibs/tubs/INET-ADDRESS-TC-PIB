    DESCRIPTION

    ::= { ibrpib 1 }

InetPortNumber ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
           "Represents a 16 bit port number of an Internet
            transport layer protocol. Port numbers are assigned by
            IANA. A list of all assignments is available from
            <http://www.iana.org/>."

InetAddressPrefixLength ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
           "Denotes the length of a generic Internet network address
            prefix. A value of n corresponds to an IP address mask
            which has n contiguous 1-bits from the most significant
            bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.
            
            InetAddressPrefixLength values that are larger than
            the maximum length of an IP address for a specific
            InetAddressType are treated as the maximum significant
            value applicable for the InetAddressType. The maximum
            significant value is 32 for the InetAddressType
            'ipv4(1)' and 128 for the InetAddressType 'ipv6(2)'.
            The maximum significant value for the InetAddressType
            'dns(16)' is 0.
            
            The value zero is object-specific and must be defined as
            part of the description of any object which uses this
            syntax. Examples of the usage of zero might include
            situations where the Internet network address prefix
            is unknown or does not apply."
