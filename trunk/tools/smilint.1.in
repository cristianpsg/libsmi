.SH NAME
smilint \- syntax and semantic checks of SMIv1/v2/ng modules
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smilint
[
.B "-Vhrs"
] [
.BI "-l " level
] [
.BI "-p " module
]
.I "module"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmilint\fP program is used to check MIB modules for syntax
errors and semantics at some degree.  Both, SMIv1/v2 and SMIng style
MIB modules are supported.
.PP
The rules that \fBsmilint\fP is based on are taken from RFC 1155, RFC
1212 and RFC 1215 for SMIv1, RFCs 2578-2580 for SMIv2 and the
specifications of SMIng that are part of a master's thesis at the
Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-V"
Show the smilint version and exit.
.TP
.B "-h"
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
.B "-s"
Report some per module statistics to stderr.
.TP
.BI "-l " level
Report errors and warnings up to the given \fIlevel\fP to stderr.
A higher level shows more warnings. The actual levels are:
.sp
.nf
 0   internal error, no recovery possible,
 1   major SMI error, recovery somehow possible but
     may lead to severe problems,
 2   SMI error, probably tolerated by some
     implementations,
 3   SMI error, tolerated by many implementations,
 4   something which is recommended to be changed,
 5   something that might be ok, but might not be
     recommended under some circumstances,
 6   just a notice.
.fi
.sp
Higher levels are actually not used and lead to the same effects as
level 5 does. Note that errors up to level 3 are errors violating the
specification and must be fixed by the responsible author. Level 3 is
the default level.
.TP
.BI "-p " module
Preload the module \fImodule\fP before reading the main module. This may
be helpful if an incomplete main module misses to import some definitions.
.TP
.B "-r"
Report errors and warnings also for imported modules.
.TP
.I module
This is the module to be checked. If it represents a path name
(identified by containing at least one dot or slash character), this
is assumed to be the exact file to read. Otherwise, if a module is
identified by its plain module name, the correspondant file (either
SMIv1/2 or SMIng) is searched along a path, which is initialized by
the \fBSMIPATH\fP environment variable or by @mibdir@ if
\fBSMIPATH\fP is not set. Files with a \fB.sming\fP extension are
expected to be SMIng module files. Files with a \fB.my\fP or without
any extension are expected to be SMIv1/v2 module files.
