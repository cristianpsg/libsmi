.SH NAME
smidump \- dump and convert SMIv1/v2/ng modules
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smidump
[
.B "-Vhs"
] [
.BI "-l " level
] [
.BI "-f " format
] [
.BI "-p " module
]
.I "module"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmidump\fP program is used to dump the contents of a single MIB
module to stdout in a selectable format. This format may be a simple
list of objects or types but also a format fully compliant to SMIv2
or SMIng. This allows to convert modules from SMIv2 to SMIng and from
SMIng to SMIv2.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-V"
Show the smidump version and exit.
.TP
.B "-h"
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
.BI "-f " format
Use \fIformat\fP when dumping a module. Supported formats are described 
below. The default format is sming.
.TP
.BI "-l " level
Report errors and warnings up to the given \fIlevel\fP to stderr.
A higher level shows more warnings. The actual levels are:
.sp
.nf
 0   internal error, no recovery possible,
 1   major SMI error, recovery somehow possible but
     may lead to severe problems,
 2   SMI error, probably tolerated by some
     implementations,
 3   SMI error, tolerated by many implementations,
 4   something which is recommended to be changed,
 5   something that might be ok, but might not be
     recommended under some circumstances,
 6   just a notice.
.fi
.sp
Higher levels are actually not used and lead to the same effects as
level 5 does. Note that errors up to level 3 are errors violating the
specification and must be fixed by the responsible author. Level 3 is
the default level.
.TP
.BI "-p " module
Preload the module \fImodule\fP before reading the main module. This may
be helpful if an incomplete main module misses to import some definitions.
.TP
.I module
This is the module to be dumped. If it represents a path name
(identified by containing at least one dot or slash character), this
is assumed to be the exact file to read. Otherwise, if a module is
identified by its plain module name, the correspondant file (either
SMIv1/2 or SMIng) is searched along a path, which is initialized by
the \fBSMIPATH\fP environment variable or by @mibdir@ if
\fBSMIPATH\fP is not set. Files with a \fB.sming\fP extension are
expected to be SMIng module files. Files with a \fB.my\fP or without
any extension are expected to be SMIv1/v2 module files.
.SH "FORMATS"
The \fBsmidump\fP program supports the following output formats:
.TP 12
sming
SMIng compliant format as defined in the SMIng Internet-Draft.
.TP
smiv2
SMIv2 compliant format as defined in RFC 2578, RFC 2579, RFC 2580.
.TP
smiv1
SMIv2 compliant format as defined in RFC 1155, RFC 1212, RFC 1215.
.TP
mosy
format generated by the mosy compiler
.TP
imports
import hierarchy of a MIB module
.TP
types
types defined in a MIB module
.TP
tree
OID tree structure of a MIB module
.TP
corba-idl
CORBA IDL definitions following the JIDM specification translation
rules
.TP
corba-oid
CORBA OID definitions following the JIDM specification translation
rules
.TP
ucd-h
C source code header file for usage within the UCD SNMP agent
.TP
ucd-c
C source code file for usage within the UCD SNMP agent

.SH "EXAMPLE"
This example converts the SMIv2 module IF-MIB in the current directory
to IF-MIB.sming in SMIng format. Note that the ./ prefix is used to
ensure reading the module from the current directory and not from a
place that libsmi guesses on its own.
.nf

  $ smidump -f sming ./IF-MIB > IF-MIB.sming
.fi
