.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmidiff\fP program is used to check differences between a pair
of SMI MIB modules. It can be used to detect changes in updated MIB
modules that can cause interoperability problems with existing
implementations. Both, SMIv1/v2 and SMIng style MIB modules are
supported.
.PP
The rules that \fBsmidiff\fP is based on are taken from RFCs 2578-2580.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-V, --verbose\fP
Show the smilint version and exit.
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB, --config=\fIfile\fP
Read \fIfile\fP instead of any other (global and user)
configuration file.
.TP
\fB-p \fImodule\fB, --preload=\fImodule\fP
Preload the module \fImodule\fP before reading the main
module(s). This may be helpful if an incomplete main module misses to
import some definitions.
.TP
\fB-l \fIlevel\fB, --level=\fIlevel\fP
Report errors and warnings up to the given severity \fIlevel\fP.
A higher level shows more warnings. The actual severity levels are:
.sp
.nf
 0   internal error, no recovery possible,
 1   major SMI error, recovery somehow possible but
     may lead to severe problems,
 2   SMI error, probably tolerated by some
     implementations,
 3   SMI error, tolerated by many implementations,
 4   something which is recommended to be changed,
 5   something that might be ok, but might not be
     recommended under some circumstances,
 6   just a notice.
.TP
.I oldmodule
The original MIB module.
.TP
.I newmodule
The updated MIB module. 
.PP
If a module argument represents a path name (identified by containing
at least one dot or slash character), this is assumed to be the exact
file to read. Otherwise, if a module is identified by its plain module
name, it is searched according to libsmi internal rules. See
\fBsmi_config(3)\fP for more details.
