INSTALLATION
============

Requirements: gcc, flex, bison, and other things most UNIX systems
have on board. The compiler has to support `long long' types. Bison
1.27 is ok. Older versions have a problem with reentrant parsers,
which is used by libsmi. Anyhow, a slight hack in the Makefile should
make at least bison 1.25 work for libsmi.

To build libsmi and the tools, run

	./configure
	make

This should build the library libsmi in lib/ and the tools, namely
tools/smilint, tools/smidump, and tools/smiquery. If you wish to
install the library, some MIB modules, the tools and all man pages, run

	make install

To use libsmi applications you might want to set the SMIPATH
environment variable to find more MIB modules than those ones
installed to @datadir@/smi/. E.g., if you have Scotty installed
along with its MIB modules, you want to add this line to your (bash
style) shell startup script:

	export SMIPATH=/usr/local/share/mibs:/usr/local/lib/tnm3.0.0/mibs


FURTHER READING
===============

Read the man pages for library concepts and usage and for the tools.
Read the SMIng specification (doc/draft-irtf-nmrg-sming-00.txt) for
details on SMIng. You may find further information online, along with
the subscription information on the libsmi mailing list at
