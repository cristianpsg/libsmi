2000-02-28  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.c: Remember the longest common OID prefix of all nodes
	defined in a module. This is used by smiGetFirstNode() and
	smiGetNextNode() to limit the searched subtree.

	* lib/smi.h.in: Dropped SmiValueformat. The way a value is
	specified in a module file is no longer visible at the API.

	0.1.x release. Only some of them are listed below.

2000-02-12  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: Rudimentary AGENT-CAPABILITIES support.
	They can be parsed to nodes and dumped as nodes or object
	identities in SMIv1/v2/ng. Other attributes than status,
	description and references are not yet supported.
	
	* lib/parser-smi.y: Solved all shift/reduce and reduce/reduce
	conflicts of the SMIv1/v2 grammar.
	
2000-02-10  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.c: Types of tables (SEQUENCE) and rows (SEQUENCE OF)
	are now hidden from the API.

	* tools/smiquery.c: implicitly defined types are no longer
	exported with visible names. So `smiquery type ...' now must
	detect node names to retrieve their implicit types.

	* mibs/ietf/SNMPv2-USEC-MIB: added module (RFC 1910).
	
	* lib/smi.c: fixed smiGetXXX() functions to find items even
	if no module is specified.

	* lib/smi.h.in: added path to struct SmiModule.
	
	* ATTENTION: all the (internal and API) data structures are
	changed for significantly improved performance. This means that
	applications must be adapted to recompile, but it's worth!

	* configure.in: incremented libtool versioning major number.
	
2000-02-09  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smilint.c: added `-c configfile' option to the three
	tools. It allows to explicitly specifiy a configuration file.
	If at least one configfile is specified no default files are
	read.

	* mibs/tubs/TUBS-SMI: some changes to the TUBS-* MIBS from Juergen.
	
	* configure.in: fixed misused $prefix
	
	* tools/dump-corba.c: fixed module names of augmented entries.

	* tools/dump-tree.c: nodes that are not defined in the local
	module are gone. augmentation entries now list the index
	elements.

	* tools/dump-smi.c: fixed SMIv1 INDEX clauses where an SMIv2
	AUGMENTS clause was parsed.

2000-02-07  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/dump-mosy.c: fixed determination of types of %tc's and 
	objects; added special type `ObjectID'. Added distinction of
	read-write/read-create. Checked output against mosy output for
	some standard modules (IF-MIB, RMON2-MIB, ...).

2000-02-06  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-sming.y: added parsing of SMIng extension statement.
	Its contents are stored in new elements of struct SmiMacro.

	information timezone idependent.

2000-02-05  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.h: removed lastupdated from SmiModule. This information has
	to be retrieved from the associated SmiRevisions, if present.

	* ATTENTION: first steps towards a reorganisation of internal
        data structures. This also leads to major changes in the API.

2000-02-02  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: Juergen added checks for illegally imported
	SMI types and ASN.1 type definitions instead of TCs in SMIv2.

2000-01-28  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: Juergen added special handling for the
	NetworkAddress SMIv1 type.

	ExtUTCTime handling.

2000-01-03  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: added revision by LAST-UPDATED clause for
	modules without any REVISION clause.

	* Juergen contributed another patch: SMIv1/SMIv2 scanner/parser
	now get numbers as numbers and not as strings. Fixed a Y2K bug in
	parser-smi.y. Make sure we use util_malloc() and friends
	everywhere. Added a length check for identifiers in SMIng. Rewrote
	the length checking code for SMIv1/SMIv2 to make it shorter.
	Removed malloc error checks that will never happen.

1999-12-22  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* Juergen contributed a lot of patches: some error cleanups,
	some scanner/parser cleanups, automatic SMI language recognition,
	and some more.

1999-12-15  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* added two IETF MIB modules.

	* fixed a recent bug on MODULE-COMPLIANCE statement parsing.

1999-12-14  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* libsmi-0.1.8.tar.gz: released version 0.1.8.

	* replaced updated SMIng I-D. updated README. minor cleanups.

	* tools/*.1.in: updated option lists in man pages.

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed wrong complaints about imported but
	unused identifiers in MODULE sections of MODULE-COMPLIANCE
	statements.

	* lib/error.c (errorSeverity): error severities can now be
	changed, e.g. by smilint `-i error-name-prefix options or config
	file `hide error-name-prefix commands, the severity of all errors
	with names prefixed by the pattern is raised to 9. this means
	they only show up at error level 9. Note, that not yet all errors
	have names, since it's not easy to find explanatory names with
	grouping prefixes.

	* lib/smi.c: new config file commands: `path' prepends an element
	to the module search path. `level' sets the error level.
	
	* lib/parser-smi.y: Opaque size restrictions are now allowed.
	Warning about Opaque usage in SMIv2 modules.

1999-12-10  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.c (smiReadConfig): a global and a user configuration
	file are now read, if existent: /usr/local/etc/smi.conf and
	~/.smirc. The first and only directive `load <module>' may be
	used to preload any MIB modules. This feature still needs some
	enhancements, like per application directives.

1999-11-01  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smidump.c: Again, Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed
	a huge chunk of patches that improve dump formats. The CORBA

	subdirectories and updated to the latest RFCs and IANA modules.

1999-10-05  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* test/Makefile.am: restructured tests slightly.
	
	* mibs/Makefile.am: added a huge amount of (nearly all current?)
	Standard MIBS and some more. They still have to be checked
	for completeness and `libsmi robustness'.

1999-10-04  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed problems with OID DEFVALS in SMIv1
	modules. now {0 0} works.

	* lib/smi.c (smiGetParentNode): fixed a bug where the wrong
	node has been returned for implicitly defined nodes as used
	in notification types.

	* lib/smi.c (smiGetNextNode): fixed a similar bug here that
	caused loops.

	* lib/parser-smi.y: added check for multiple groups or
	object refinements for the same object in a single
	compliance statement. this caused loops before.

	* tools/smidump.c: applied another patch by Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that beautifies various dump formats and introduces a regression
	test system.
	
1999-10-01  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed range of Counter64.

	* tools/dump-types.c: applied a patch by Juergen Schoenwaelder

1999-09-30  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed some more decl settings.

	* tools/smidump.c: applied a huge patch by Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that reorganizes the smidump format modules and adds a (not
	yet compiled) new format for xfig figures.

1999-09-29  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/data.h: new struct Value. Now all smi.h structs are
	separated from the data.h structs. This was needed to handle
	OID DEFVALs correctly.
	
	* tools/smiquery.c (main): added default values und beatified
	some other output.

	* lib/smi.h: SMI_DECL_IMPLICIT_TYPE denotes implicitly defined
	types. Fixed some other decl settings for types in the SMIv1/v2
	parser.

	* tools/dump-data.c: Applied a patch from Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that fixes some types for the tree dump format.
	
1999-09-27  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* configure.in: added checks for 64bit strtoX() functions to
	work on FreeBSD systems.

1999-09-24  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/dump-smi.c: fixed some generated import for SMIv1
	modules. also fixed some typename conversions for SMIv2
	modules generated from SMIv1.

	* lib/smi.c: fixed a conceptual bug that led to loops when a
	single node appears multiple times in a list like in OBJECTS
	of a NOTIFICATION-TYPE. This is similar to the earlier bug with
	multiple items in an index clause. Hence, the struct SmiIndex
	has been renamed to SmiListItem is used for different kinds
	of lists. This also made some API functions obsolete that have
	been removed: smiGetFirst/NextMemberNode,
	smiGetFirst/NextObjectNode, smiGetFirst/NextMandatoryNode.
	The bug has been reported by Ira Wolf on comp.protocols.snmp.

1999-09-23  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/data.c (mergeNodeTrees): fixed a nasty ptr bug reported
	by Jochen Friedrich some weeks ago.

	* lib/parser-sming.y: a checkFormat() call contained a wrong
	argument, leading to claimed format data that are correct.

	* lib/parser-smi.y: David Reeder pointed out a slight bug where
	an error message contained a wrong argument.

	* tools/dump-mosy.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed further
	patches to various dump modules and some checks in SMI and SMIng
	parsers.
	
	* tools/dump-ucdsnmp.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed this
	new dump module that generates UCD-SNMP mib2c like output.
	
1999-07-09  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* mibs/: extracted updated MIB modules from RFCs.

	* lib/data.c: findObjectByNode() now first looks for objects in
	the current view.

1999-07-02  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smidump.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed further
	smidump cleanup and formats: CORBA IDL files can be written
	according to the JIDM specifications (formats corba-idl and
	corba-oid) and nice trees of MIB nodes can be drawn with the
	tree format.

1999-06-30  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/error.c: added minor checks

	* lib/smi.h: removed SEQUENCE and SEQUENCEOF basetypes.
	Removed WRITE_ONLY and READ_CREATE access values.

1999-06-22  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smidump.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed another
	smidump patch: now smidump supports SMIv1 output format.

	* libsmi-0.1.5.tar.gz: released version 0.1.5.

	* tools/dump-java.c: started a new dump format that represents
	java classes for MIB tables. This is experimental and may be
	removed from smidump in future revisions.

	* lib/data.c: more changes to internal data structure to make
	them language independant, especially hiding all occurances
	of the SMIng namespace operator `::'.

	* data.c: cleaned up libsmi base types to be less language
	dependant.

	* lib/smi.h: add API function smiGetNodeByOID() to retrieve
	an SmiNode based on an OID given by an integer array.

	* lib/smi.c: smiGetNode() now returns the node with the longest
	common OID prefix, if its argument is given by OID.
	
1999-06-15  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.h: added SmiLanguage and an appropriate element to the
	SmiModule struct to represent the language that has been used to
	read a MIB module.

1999-06-14  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.h: Hiding knowledge on the underlying language from
	the API: SmiNode contains a new element `nodekind' that represents
	the kind of any node in the tree independant from the actual
	language statement. Hence, most application no longer need to
	use SmiDecl. smiquery and smidump are adapted accordingly.

1999-06-11  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.c: implemented smiGetFirstChild() and smiGetNextChild().

	* lib/smi.h: OIDs are now represented by a more efficient array
	of integers instead of a string.

1999-06-10  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/dump-sming.c: fixed bug when printing OIDs with more
	than one trailing sub-identifiers that cannot be resolved to
	identifers.
	
	* tools/dump-sming.c (printGroups): no longer sorting group
	statements separately based on underlying OG/NG types, but
	continuously based on OID.

	* lib/smi.c (smiGetNode): fixed bug, when retrieving node by
	OID.

1999-06-07  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: bugfix: allow status `deprecated' in SMIv1
	modules.

	* tools/smiquery.c: adapted index command.

	* lib/smi.h: had to add struct SmiIndex and smiGetFirstIndex()
	and smiGetNextIndex(), since otherwise we have no chance to
	distinguish objects that apear more than once in a single
	index clause, like in RMON2-MIB::alHostEntry.

	* mibs/RFC1271-MIB: MIB file added.
	
	* tools/dump-sming.c: some bugfixes.

	* lib/parser-sming.y: bugfix for adjustments of forward references
	in index structs.
