1999-12-10  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.c (smiReadConfig): a global and a user configuration
	file are now read, if existent: /usr/local/etc/smi.conf and
	~/.smirc. The first and only directive `load <module>' may be
	used to preload any MIB modules. This feature still needs some
	enhancements, like per application directives.

1999-11-01  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smidump.c: Again, Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed
	a huge chunk of patches that improve dump formats. The CORBA
	IDL output is updated and an smidump option to suppress comments
	(-s) has been added.

1999-10-25  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smistrip.in (VERSION): smistrip (plus man page) has
	been added to the libsmi distribution. It allows to extract
	modules from text documents like RFCs and I-Ds.

1999-10-07  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/error.c: added check for illegal type restrictions
	in SEQUENCEs.

1999-10-06  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* mibs/Makefile.am: the MIB module files have been reorganized in
	subdirectories and updated to the latest RFCs and IANA modules.

1999-10-05  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* test/Makefile.am: restructured tests slightly.
	
	* mibs/Makefile.am: added a huge amount of (nearly all current?)
	Standard MIBS and some more. They still have to be checked
	for completeness and `libsmi robustness'.

1999-10-04  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed problems with OID DEFVALS in SMIv1
	modules. now {0 0} works.

	* lib/smi.c (smiGetParentNode): fixed a bug where the wrong
	node has been returned for implicitly defined nodes as used
	in notification types.

	* lib/smi.c (smiGetNextNode): fixed a similar bug here that
	caused loops.

	* lib/parser-smi.y: added check for multiple groups or
	object refinements for the same object in a single
	compliance statement. this caused loops before.

	* tools/smidump.c: applied another patch by Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that beautifies various dump formats and introduces a regression
	test system.
	
1999-10-01  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed range of Counter64.

	* tools/dump-types.c: applied a patch by Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that beautifies the dump formats for imports and types.

1999-09-30  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed some more decl settings.

	* tools/smidump.c: applied a huge patch by Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that reorganizes the smidump format modules and adds a (not
	yet compiled) new format for xfig figures.

1999-09-29  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/data.h: new struct Value. Now all smi.h structs are
	separated from the data.h structs. This was needed to handle
	OID DEFVALs correctly.
	
	* tools/smiquery.c (main): added default values und beatified
	some other output.

	* lib/smi.h: SMI_DECL_IMPLICIT_TYPE denotes implicitly defined
	types. Fixed some other decl settings for types in the SMIv1/v2
	parser.

	* tools/dump-data.c: Applied a patch from Juergen Schoenwaelder
	that fixes some types for the tree dump format.
	
1999-09-27  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* configure.in: added checks for 64bit strtoX() functions to
	work on FreeBSD systems.

1999-09-24  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/dump-smi.c: fixed some generated import for SMIv1
	modules. also fixed some typename conversions for SMIv2
	modules generated from SMIv1.

	* lib/smi.c: fixed a conceptual bug that led to loops when a
	single node appears multiple times in a list like in OBJECTS
	of a NOTIFICATION-TYPE. This is similar to the earlier bug with
	multiple items in an index clause. Hence, the struct SmiIndex
	has been renamed to SmiListItem is used for different kinds
	of lists. This also made some API functions obsolete that have
	been removed: smiGetFirst/NextMemberNode,
	smiGetFirst/NextObjectNode, smiGetFirst/NextMandatoryNode.
	The bug has been reported by Ira Wolf on comp.protocols.snmp.

1999-09-23  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/data.c (mergeNodeTrees): fixed a nasty ptr bug reported
	by Jochen Friedrich some weeks ago.

	* lib/parser-sming.y: a checkFormat() call contained a wrong
	argument, leading to claimed format data that are correct.

	* lib/parser-smi.y: David Reeder pointed out a slight bug where
	an error message contained a wrong argument.

	* tools/dump-mosy.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed further
	patches to various dump modules and some checks in SMI and SMIng
	parsers.
	
	* tools/dump-ucdsnmp.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed this
	new dump module that generates UCD-SNMP mib2c like output.
	
1999-07-09  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* mibs/: extracted updated MIB modules from RFCs.

	* lib/data.c: findObjectByNode() now first looks for objects in
	the current view.

1999-07-02  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smidump.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed further
	smidump cleanup and formats: CORBA IDL files can be written
	according to the JIDM specifications (formats corba-idl and
	corba-oid) and nice trees of MIB nodes can be drawn with the
	tree format.

1999-06-30  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/error.c: added minor checks

	* lib/smi.h: removed SEQUENCE and SEQUENCEOF basetypes.

1999-06-22  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* tools/smidump.c: Juergen Schoenwaelder contributed another
	smidump patch: now smidump supports SMIv1 output format.

1999-06-21  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/data.c: fixed a bug with merging two subtrees of nodes
	defined in two separate MIB files (reported by Jochen Friedrich).

1999-06-17  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: fixed incorrect base types of SNMPv2-SMI
	application types.

1999-06-16  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* libsmi-0.1.5.tar.gz: released version 0.1.5.

	* tools/dump-java.c: started a new dump format that represents
	java classes for MIB tables. This is experimental and may be
	removed from smidump in future revisions.

	* lib/data.c: more changes to internal data structure to make
	them language independant, especially hiding all occurances
	of the SMIng namespace operator `::'.

	* data.c: cleaned up libsmi base types to be less language
	dependant.

	* lib/smi.h: add API function smiGetNodeByOID() to retrieve
	an SmiNode based on an OID given by an integer array.

	* lib/smi.c: smiGetNode() now returns the node with the longest
	common OID prefix, if its argument is given by OID.
	
1999-06-15  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.h: added SmiLanguage and an appropriate element to the
	SmiModule struct to represent the language that has been used to
	read a MIB module.

1999-06-14  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.h: Hiding knowledge on the underlying language from
	the API: SmiNode contains a new element `nodekind' that represents
	the kind of any node in the tree independant from the actual
	language statement. Hence, most application no longer need to
	use SmiDecl. smiquery and smidump are adapted accordingly.

1999-06-11  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/smi.c: implemented smiGetFirstChild() and smiGetNextChild().

	* lib/smi.h: OIDs are now represented by a more efficient array
	of integers instead of a string.

1999-06-10  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* test/parser.test.in: started to write a set of MIB modules

	any compliance statement.

	* libsmi-0.1.4.tar.gz: released version 0.1.4.

	* lib/error.h: undef'ed yyerror to suppress compile warning.

	* tools/dump-sming.c (printObjects): fixed bug with missing
	nodes read from OBJECT-IDENTITY constructs.

	* lib/parser-sming.y: fixed bug in name creation of pseudo types
	in compliance statements.

	* lib/parser-sming.y: fixed various SMIng related bugs.

	* tools/dump-sming.c: fixed bug when printing OIDs with more
	than one trailing sub-identifiers that cannot be resolved to
	identifers.
	
	* tools/dump-sming.c (printGroups): no longer sorting group
	statements separately based on underlying OG/NG types, but
	continuously based on OID.

	* lib/smi.c (smiGetNode): fixed bug, when retrieving node by
	OID.

1999-06-07  Frank Strauss  <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>

	* lib/parser-smi.y: bugfix: allow status `deprecated' in SMIv1
	modules.

	* tools/smiquery.c: adapted index command.

	* lib/smi.h: had to add struct SmiIndex and smiGetFirstIndex()

	distinguish objects that apear more than once in a single
	index clause, like in RMON2-MIB::alHostEntry.

	* mibs/RFC1271-MIB: MIB file added.
	
	* tools/dump-sming.c: some bugfixes.

	* lib/parser-sming.y: bugfix for adjustments of forward references
	in index structs.
