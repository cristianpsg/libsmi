INSTALLATION
============

Requirements: gcc, flex, bison, and other things most UNIX systems
have on board. The compiler has to support `long long' types.

To configure libsmi, first check

	./configure --help

output to see, what options are available. Then run ./configure with the
options of your choice. Choose mibdir and smipath values appripriate
for your environment so that users can live without an SMIPATH
environment variable. Note, that SMIng is not supported by default.

To build libsmi and the tools, run

	make

This should build the library libsmi in lib/ and the tools, namely
tools/smilint, tools/smidump, and tools/smiquery.

To run some checks, type

	make checks

If you wish to install the library, some basic MIB modules, the tools
and the man pages, run

	make install

To use libsmi applications you might want to set the SMIPATH
environment variable to find more MIB modules than those ones
installed to places that libsmi knows. E.g., if you have Scotty
installed along with its MIB modules, you might want to add this line
to your (bash style) shell startup script:

	export SMIPATH=/usr/local/share/mibs:/usr/local/lib/tnm3.0.0/mibs

Or this one, to extend the libsmi search path (note the leading colon):

	export SMIPATH=":/usr/local/lib/tnm3.0.0/mibs"


FURTHER READING
===============

Read the man pages for library concepts and usage and for the tools.
Read the SMIng specification (doc/draft-irtf-nmrg-sming-00.txt) for
details on SMIng. You may find further information online, along with
the subscription information on the libsmi mailing list at
