INSTALLATION
============

Requirements: gcc, flex, bison, and other things most UNIX systems
have on board. The compiler has to support `long long' types.

To configure libsmi, first check

	./configure --help

output to see, what options are available. Then run ./configure with
the options of your choice. Choose mibdir and smipath values
appripriate for your environment so that users can live without an
SMIPATH environment variable and without configuration files.

To build libsmi and the tools, run

	make

This should build the library libsmi in lib/ and the tools, namely
tools/smilint, tools/smidump, tools/smiquery, and the shell script
tools/smistrip.

If you wish to install the library, some basic MIB modules, the tools
and the man pages, run

	make install

If you have run make install (sorry, not beforehand), you may run some
checks:

	make check

To use libsmi applications you might want to configure its behaviour.
You can set the SMIPATH environment variable to find more MIB modules
than those ones installed to places that libsmi knows. E.g., if you
have Scotty installed along with its MIB modules, you might want to
add this line to your (bash style) shell startup script:

	export SMIPATH=/usr/local/share/mibs:/usr/local/lib/tnm3.0.0/mibs

Or this one, to extend the libsmi search path (note the leading colon):

	export SMIPATH=":/usr/local/lib/tnm3.0.0/mibs"

More detailed library options, including per-application optionsm, can
be configured through a global and a user level configuration file. See
the smi_config(3) man page.


DEBUGGING
=========



FURTHER READING
===============

Read the man pages for library concepts and usage and for the tools.
Read the SMIng specification (doc/draft-irtf-nmrg-sming-01.txt) for
details on SMIng. You may find further information online, along with
the subscription information on the libsmi mailing list at
