This project has been started as part of Frank Strauss' master's
thesis at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany.

This software comprises 

 - a library to parse and maintain MIB and PIB modules,

 - a set of tools based on the library to check, convert, and compare
   MIB and PIB modules.

Please read the manual pages and the project's web pages for further
information.

INSTALLATION
============

Requirements: gcc, flex, bison, and other things most UNIX systems
have on board. The compiler has to support `long long' types.

To configure libsmi, first check

	./configure --help

output to see, what options are available. Then run

	./configure [options]

with the options of your choice. Choose mibdir, pibdir and smipath
values appripriate for your environment so that users can live without
an SMIPATH environment variable and without configuration files.

On HP-UX platforms the build process is reported to require gcc
and the --disable-shared configure option.

On MacOS X (darwin-power-pc) platforms the standard build process 
gives the following warning "smi.h:56: warning: use of `long double'
type; its size may change in a future release". Users can disable
this warning with the --with-cflags="-Wno-long-double" configure
option.

To build libsmi and the tools, run

	make

This should build the library libsmi in lib/ and the tools, namely
tools/smilint, tools/smidump, tools/smiquery, tools/smidiff, and the
shell script tools/smistrip.

Now, you may run some checks by

	make check

Note that some tests of this test suite may fail, if GNU diff was not
found.

If you wish to install the library, the MIB and PIB modules, the tools
and the man pages, run

	make install

To use libsmi applications you might want to configure its behaviour.
Detailed library options, including per-application options, can
be configured through a global and a user level configuration file.
Additionally the SMIPATH environment variable can be used to configure
paths of module locations. See the smi_config(3) man page.


DEBUGGING
=========

If you encounter any crashes or feel for any other reasons the need to
debug the libsmi tools, you should link the tools statically. This is
the easiest way to get around the problems when your debugger claims to
be unable to read the libsmi binary files, since they are built using
libtool. You can build the libsmi tools statically by

	make clean
	./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
	make


FURTHER READING
===============

Read the man pages for library concepts and usage and for the tools.
Please note that SMIng is currently in a quite inconsistent and outdated
state. It does not reflect what is being discussed in the IETF SMING WG
after spring 2001. See the old specs in doc/draft-irtf-nmrg-sming-02.txt
for details on SMIng as it is implemented so far.
