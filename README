INSTALLATION
============

Requirements: gcc, flex, bison, and other things most UNIX systems
have on board. The compiler has to support `long long' types. Bison
1.27 is ok. Older versions have a problem with reentrant parsers,
which is used by libsmi. Anyhow, a slight hack in the Makefile should
make at least bison 1.25 work for libsmi.

Sorry, libsmi does not yet have autoconf support.

After checking the Makefile for local requirements, type `make'. This
should build the static library lib/libsmi.a and the tools, namely
tools/smilint, tools/smidump, and tools/smiquery. If you wish to
install it, type `make install'.


FURTHER READING
===============

Read the man pages for library concepts and usage and for the tools.
Read the SMIng specification for details on SMIng. You may find further
information online at http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/~strauss/sming/. If
this fails, contact me, <strauss@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de>.
