Libsmi 0.1 is available for download.

Libsmi is a C library that allows network management applications to
access MIB module information through a well defined API that hides
the nasty details of locating and parsing SMIv1/v2 MIB modules.

Libsmi supports exact and iterative retrieval functions for all major
SMIv1 and SMIv2 constructs (except the AGENT-CAPABILITIES statement).

The layered concept of libsmi allows to add further methods to
retrieve MIB information from persistent repositories. In fact,
besides the SMIv1/v2 MIB file parser an additional parser for `SMIng'
is included. Both parsers are built on flex/bison grammar specifications.

SMIng is a research project concerned with the definition of a MIB
module language that is semantically fully compatible with SMIv2 but
avoids many problems of the ASN.1 based SMI versions.

Included with the library, are three tools that make use of libsmi:
Smiquery allows simple queries of single MIB module items.  Smilint
allows to increase the verbosity of the parser(s), so that MIB modules
can be checked for syntax and semantic errors. Finally, smidump can be
used to dump MIB modules. Currently, SMIng and SMIv2 are supported as
output formats, so that SMIv2 <-> SMIng conversions are possible.

The software comes with autoconf and libtool support. Hence it should
compile and build with shared libraries on most UNIX style platforms,
though it's just tested successfully on Sun Solaris 2.5.x and Linux.
