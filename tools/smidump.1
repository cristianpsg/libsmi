.SH NAME
smidump \- dump and convert SMIv1/v2/ng modules
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smidump
[
.B "-Vh"
] [
.BI "-f " format
] [
.BI "-p " module
]
.I "module"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmidump\fP program is used to dump the contents of a single MIB
module to stdout in a selectable format. This format may be a simple
list of objects or types but also a format fully compliant to SMIv2
or SMIng. This allows to convert modules from SMIv2 to SMIng and from
SMIng to SMIv2.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-V"
Show the smidump version and exit.
.TP
.B "-h"
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
.BI "-f " format
Use \fIformat\fP when dumping a module. Supported formats are
\fBsming\fP for fully compliant SMIng, \fBsmiv2\fP for fully compliant
SMIv2, \fBobjects\fP for a simple list of nodes in the object
identifer tree known to libsmi (only for libsmi debugging) and
\fBtypes\fP for a simple list of all types known to libsmi (also
for libsmi debugging only). The default is to dump in SMIng format.
.TP
.BI "-p " module
Preload the module \fImodule\fP before reading the main module. This may
be helpful if an incomplete main module misses to import some definitions.
.TP
.I module
This is the module to be dumped. If it represents a path name
(identified by containing at least one dot or slash character), this
is assumed to be the exact file to read. Otherwise, if a module is
identified by its plain module name, the correspondant file (either
SMIv1/2 or SMIng) is searched along a path, which is initialized by
the \fBSMIPATH\fP environment variable or by @prefix@/lib/smi if
\fBSMIPATH\fP is not set. Files with a \fB.sming\fP extension are
expected to be SMIng module files. Files with a \fB.my\fP or without
any extension are expected to be SMIv1/v2 module files.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
This example converts the SMIv2 module IF-MIB in the current directory
to IF-MIB.sming in SMIng format. Note that the ./ prefix is used to
ensure reading the module from the current directory and not from a
place that libsmi guesses on its own.
.nf

  $ smidump -f sming ./IF-MIB > IF-MIB.sming
.fi
.SH "FILES"
.nf
/usr/local/etc/smi.conf     general configuration file
/usr/local/etc/smidump.conf smidump configuration file
.fi
.SH "NOTES"
Libsmi and this tool are work in progress. Expect changes in near
future.
