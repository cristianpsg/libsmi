.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmidiff\fP program is used to check differences between a pair
of SMI MIB modules or SPPI PIB modules.
E.g., it can be used to detect changes in updated MIB
modules that can cause interoperability problems with existing
implementations. SMIv1/v2, SPPI and SMIng style MIB modules are
supported.
.PP
Note that conformance statements are currently not checked.
.PP
Messages describing the differences are written to the standard output
channel while error and warning messages generated by the parser
are written to the standard error channel.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-V, --verbose\fP
Show the smilint version and exit.
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
Show a help text and exit.
.TP
\fB-s, --severity\fP
Show the error severity in brackets before error messages.
.TP
\fB-m, --error-names\fP
Show the error names in braces before error messages.
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB, --config=\fIfile\fP
Read \fIfile\fP instead of any other (global and user)
configuration file.
.TP
\fB-p \fImodule\fB, --preload=\fImodule\fP
Preload the module \fImodule\fP before reading the main
module(s). This may be helpful if an incomplete main module misses to
import some definitions.
.TP
\fB-l \fIlevel\fB, --level=\fIlevel\fP
Report errors and warnings up to the given severity \fIlevel\fP.
A higher level shows more warnings. The actual severity levels are:
.sp
.nf
 0   internal error, no recovery possible,
 1   major SMI/SPPI error, recovery somehow possible but
     may lead to severe problems,
 2   SMI error, probably tolerated by some
     implementations,
 3   SMI/SPPI error, tolerated by many implementations,
 4   something which is recommended to be changed,
 5   something that might be ok, but might not be
     recommended under some circumstances,
 6   just a notice.
.TP
\fB-i \fIprefix\fB, --ignore=\fIprefix\fP
Ignore all errors that have a tag which matches \fIprefix\fP.
.TP
.I oldmodule
The original module.
.TP
.I newmodule
The updated module. 
.PP
If a module argument represents a path name (identified by containing
at least one dot or slash character), this is assumed to be the exact
file to read. Otherwise, if a module is identified by its plain module
name, it is searched according to libsmi internal rules. See
\fBsmi_config(3)\fP for more details.
